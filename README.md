# ScrapingChallenge
This repository contains Python code that analyzes weather data from the Mars Curiosity rover, as scraped from the NASA Mars website. The code uses the pandas library to process and visualize the data.

Files
mars_weather_scraper.py: This script scrapes the weather data from the NASA Mars website and stores it in a CSV file called mars_weather.csv.
mars_weather.csv: This file contains the raw weather data for each Martian sol, as well as corresponding data in terrestrial date format.
mars_weather_analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code that analyzes the weather data, including calculating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and answering questions about the data.

How many months are there on Mars?
How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
